# Consumer-Driven-Contract Test 
## Java Modules
All Java modules require **Java 14** to compile and run.

### Building with Gradle 6.4.1

Each module should be an independent build and can be built by calling `./gradlew clean build` in the module directory. 

All modules are listed in [build-all.sh](build-all.sh) to run in the CI pipeline.
